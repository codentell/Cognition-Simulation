## About The Project

This project is a streamlined React + Vite starter template designed for rapid development. It provides:

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for fast feedback during development.
- Integration with **Supabase**, enabling easy backend interactions.
- Minimal setup with basic **ESLint rules** to ensure code quality.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file in the root directory, following the template below. Replace placeholders with your Supabase details:

   ```plaintext
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-key>
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

### Setting up Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Home > Connect > React/Vite > Vercel**.
3. Copy your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` and add them to your `.env` file as shown in the [installation](#installation) section.

### Run the App

Use the following commands during development:

- **Start Development Server**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Build for Production**:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Preview Production Build**:

  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```
